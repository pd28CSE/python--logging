# Python Logging


Software logging is a way to monitor events that occur during software operation. For software development, debugging, and operation, logging is essential.
It is unlikely that you would find the source of the issue if your software fails without any logging records. And it will take a lot of time to find the cause.
By logging, you can create a breadcrumb trail that will help us identify the issue's root cause in the event that something goes wrong.
